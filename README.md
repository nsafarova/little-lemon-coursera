This is a capstone project created as part of a [Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer) course. The project is a website for Little Lemon restaurant, a fictional restaurant that serves delicious Mediterranean food. The website is built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. React routers are used to navigate between pages and state management techniques are implemented to manage the application's state.
